# Packaging Optimizer
This desktop application is used for generating optimal layout for packing rectangular objects into containers, 
while the set of constraints needs to be satisfied for a result to be valid.

Optimization algorithm implemented within this application is modification and extension of the [First fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-fit_bin_packing) optimization algorithm.

_... Application is still under development ..._
